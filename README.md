# CNN-Model-for-SoilX
This project aims to develop intelligent moisture characterization by utilizing drone-based radar signal transmission and data analysis. With the increasing challenges posed by climate change, efficient water management in agriculture has become crucial. Farmers require precise information to optimize irrigation practices, minimize water waste, and maintain soil health. Our project addresses this need by leveraging radar technology mounted on drones to create root-zone moisture maps. By analyzing reflected radio frequency (RF) signals from Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) systems, we aim to provide non-invasive, large-scale soil moisture measurements. This approach offers rapid, accurate assessments essential for agricultural decision-making, environmental monitoring, and hydrological research. Through the development of custom radar hardware and software, coupled with innovative data analysis techniques, we seek to establish a reliable and scalable solution for soil moisture detection. Our findings have the potential to revolutionize agricultural practices, leading to improved water resource management and enhanced sustainability in food production.
